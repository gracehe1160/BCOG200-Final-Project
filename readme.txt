# BCOG200-Final-Project

1) I would like to create a chatbot, following one of the example suggestions on the final project page. This chatbot will respond and have conversations with the user input. I will use the Natural Language Toolkit and the ChatterBot library to create this program.
2) 
a. The function CreatePersonality will create the chatbot using the ChatterBot library, and in doing so will give it a name and a personality. At this moment, the decided personality will be sarcastic/humorous and friendly.
b. The function ReadInput will process the user input with the nltk library in order to formulate a response in the next function.
c. The function GenerateResponse will do the actual response building and print the conversation.
